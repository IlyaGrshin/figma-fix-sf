# Fix San Francisco

**Warning:** This plugin won't fix the city's problems, but it will automatically apply the [correct font variant and tracking](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/#font-usage-and-tracking) for selected texts using the San Francisco typeface.

Usually, you'd use the built-in text styles when designing for iOS. However, if your project needs to use custom font sizes, this plugin's got your back for a more accurate representation of how they're rendered in iOS.
